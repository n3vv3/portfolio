            <div class="item4">
                <p>Hi, I am Elin. I'm currently on the final stretch of my BSc. in Interaction design at Stockholm University, and at the time being I'm an UX intern at SVT Play. I believe that inclusive design is of great importance and that we should acknowledge the fact that technology will be new to all of us at some point. Therefore I find it important to consider potential research behind every experience and make the inte_raction effortless as well as coherent for the user.

                <h4>Consistency SVT Play</h4>
                <p>At the time being I have a project about mapping user needs across all SVT Plays platforms, such as web, app and TV. The main idea is to go to the core of user needs by exploring driving forces and needs with our users. My idea is that mapping these core elements will contribute to a more coherent and harmonized experience in our platforms. To do this I am having user tests, sketching user flows and facilitating workshops inhouse. Besides mapping out user needs I am involved in another project concerning initializing a design system at SVT Play. <br><br> All of this is done alongside working with the double diamond method in an agile manner. </p>

                <h4>AR Sandbox</h4>
                <p>As our latest design challenge we decided to investigate how to make an art experience interactive. We were inspired by open source code that used augmented reality to teach topography in the sand for children, this was done by measuring the depths in the sand with an infrared camera and a projector. During a two months process we did contextual inquiries to get an understanding of museums and their visitors, we also had a bodystorming session with users where they tested a lo-fi prototype consisting of yougurt and coloring essence. The final result was an interactive sandbox that allowed you to manipulate the projected colors with your hands, while livestreaming the tempory art on an adjacent wall. </p>

                <h4>Plogger</h4>
                <p>I developed a prototype for the theme Civic Design in the course Advanced Human Computer Interaction. The idea behind the prototype was to combine jogging/walking and picking up litter in your neighbourhood. In the prototype you
                    could either join an event or create your own. Another functionality was your own contribution to a cleaner environment by showing the amount of picked up litter. The design process included several iterations, at first I had
                    two explorative interviews to gather user research. After that I made sketches on paper. The third iteration was to create a more interactive prototype, which was done in Figma. Following I did three user tests, with observations and
                follow-up interviews. </p>

                <h4>LärIT</h4>
                <p>During a course in Participatory Design we made a prototype for elderly users. The purpose was to make technology more inclusive and available. We created a website in Axure were they could practice on creating and naming folders, which was a typical example of everyday challenges for them. The design process consisted of four steps, at first we made a contexual inquiry by observing and interviewing users. Next up was generating ideas on post-its and the third step was a prototyping workshop. The last step was user testing and follow-up interviews.

                    <h4>Momondo vs. Supersavertravel</h4>
                    <p>At the time of my first semester I had a course in Evaluation methods which focused on user centered design. In the course we chose to evaluate and compare global travel search sites such as Momondo and Supersavertravel where the purpose was to test usability using the ISO standard 9241-11. <br><br> The project started with research and contacting potential future users. Initially we made pilot tests to get an idea of the estimated time and effort for the tests. We decided to use scenarios and conduct the tests in the users home environment. During the tests we took notes and counted clicks to make sure we used the ISO standard. The result was a report with ideas for redesign of the two websites. </p>
