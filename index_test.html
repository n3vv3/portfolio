        <p> Hi, I am Elin. I'm currently on the final stretch of my BSc. in Interaction design at Stockholm University,
          and at the time being I'm an UX intern at SVT Play. I believe that inclusive design is of great importance and
          that we should acknowledge the fact that technology will be new to all of us at some point. Therefore I find
          it important to consider potential research behind every experience and make the interaction effortless as
          well as coherent for the user. </p>

      <h4>Consistency SVT Play</h4>
      <p>At the time being I have a project about mapping user needs across all SVT Plays platforms, such as web, app
        and
        TV. The main idea is to go to the core of user needs by exploring driving forces and needs with our users. My
        idea
        is that mapping these core elements will contribute to a more coherent and harmonized experience in our
        platforms.
        To do this I am having user tests, sketching user flows and facilitating workshops inhouse. Besides mapping out
        user needs I am involved in another project concerning initializing a design system at SVT Play. All of
        this is done alongside working with the double diamond method in an agile manner. </p>

      <h4>AR Sandbox</h4>
      <p>As our latest design challenge we decided to investigate how to make an art experience interactive. We were
        inspired by open source code that used augmented reality to teach topography in the sand for children, this was
        done by measuring the depths in the sand with an infrared camera and a projector. During a two months process we
        did contextual inquiries to get an understanding of museums and their visitors, we also had a bodystorming
        session
        with users where they tested a lo-fi prototype consisting of yougurt and coloring essence. The final result was
        an
        interactive sandbox that allowed you to manipulate the projected colors with your hands, while livestreaming the
        tempory art on an adjacent wall.</p>
